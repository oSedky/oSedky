# 👋 Hi, I'm Omar Sedky

AWS Certified Solutions Architect (SAA-C03) with a background in enterprise endpoint management (Microsoft Intune, M365) and a hands-on approach to learning through applied projects. I'm actively designing and documenting AWS solutions that reflect realistic business and technical scenarios.

## 🧩 Projects in Progress

I’m currently building and testing cloud solutions in the following areas:

- Serverless automation (Lambda, SES, S3, Polly)  
- Scalable infrastructure (EC2, RDS, ALB, VPC)  
- CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, CodePipeline)  
- Cloud integrations simulating enterprise use cases  

Each project is focused on service integration, operational reliability, and architectural best practices.
